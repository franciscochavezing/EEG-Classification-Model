# EEG Classification Model

In this completed project, our group successfully built a classification model for EEG data, categorizing it into distinct classes, with a specific focus on epilepsy diagnosis. We utilized two datasets, the CHB-MIT EEG Database and the Bonn EEG Dataset, for both training and evaluation. Our workflow involved comprehensive data preprocessing, including downloading, extracting, and exploring datasets, as well as addressing missing values and noise reduction. Feature extraction encompassed time-domain and frequency-domain features, followed by the careful division of data into training, validation, and test sets. We chose an appropriate machine learning model, considering CNNs and RNNs, and implemented robust training strategies, including measures to prevent overfitting. The model's performance was rigorously evaluated on the test set, and the results were effectively visualized and presented in a detailed report covering introduction, preprocessing, feature extraction, model details, evaluation results, and future considerations.
